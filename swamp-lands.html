            <h2>Cultural Insights</h2>
            <p>The Vyr’Zal live in settlements built on raised platforms and within large hollow trees to avoid the swamp's ever-present dangers. They revere the spirits of the swamp, and their society is structured around respecting the balance between life and death, growth and decay. The Venomscale Shamans serve as the spiritual and magical leaders, while the Marshscale Warriors and Bogfang Raiders provide physical protection and enforcement of their laws. The Siltborn Artisans and Tanglethorn Hunters ensure the tribe’s survival, while the Mirestalker Scouts gather intelligence on their surroundings. The Slimescale Sentries and Bogbrute Elders protect their sacred sites and ensure that their culture and traditions are passed down through the generations.</p>
